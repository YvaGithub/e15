My project p3 is about circle where alumni and former teaching staffs from Hyde Park University can meet to share stories about their lives on and out of campus. An alumnus or a former teaching staff can register with an email which is required and once registered, the new member will be able to view the profile of other members.In the process of creating the application, I sometimes checked stack overflow as outside sources to help me with solving errors.
Below is the result of the test that I ran to check the application.
